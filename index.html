        <p>Starting with a simple online learning tool, Quizlet today offers tools for students to make flashcards, practice spelling, play learning games, test their knowledge, collaborate with other students, and more.</p>
        <p>Seeing the humble beginnings of Quizlet, we here at Why, Why Not Industries were inspired to create our own online learning tool.</p>

        <h3>Meet the Developers</h3>
        <p>A long time ago, in a galaxy not so far away, there was an Earth that we all call home.</p>
        <p>Upon creating such a monstrous studying tool, a team of thinkers was formed on a couple of simple questions.</p>
        <p>Would you like to be my partner?</p>
        <p>Why?</p>
        <p>Why Not?</p>
        <p>And with that, it was settled, the thinkers NY and WY formed a dynamic duo.</p>
        <p>Not just representing the two states New York and Wyoming,</p>
        <p>(who knows if Wyoming even exists?),</p>
        <p>Team Why? Why Not? has decided to embark on a journey through quizlet.</p>
